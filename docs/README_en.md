List of Hardest Brazilian Levels in Geometry Dash.

## Background üìÑ

Created in June 2020 by yuuchouze/lucastozo, the Demonlist BR, inspired by other Geometry Dash lists such as Pointercrate Demonlist, aimed to classify the hardest Brazilian levels in the game. The initial project was basic and made using Google Sites, which made the site extremely slow and impossible to scale and maintain, leading the project to end a few months later. The project was redone in 2021 by other people, but since it had the same problems, it also became inactive.

At the end of 2023, the project was completely redone from scratch by yuuchouze, but this time with the intention of being easily maintainable, scalable, and faster than a site made with Google Sites. It is currently the most complete BR Demonlist project to date.
